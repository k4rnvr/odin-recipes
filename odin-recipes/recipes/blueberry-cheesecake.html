            <li>Mix graham crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until well combined. Pat mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>Mash cream cheese in a mixing bowl until soft and creamy. Gradually beat in sour cream, 3/4 cup sugar, flour, and vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Pour mixture into the crumb-lined pan</li>

            <li>Remove cheesecake from the pan by loosening the edges with a knife and opening the springform latch. Transfer to a serving platter. Place frozen blueberries on top. Melt jelly in a saucepan over low heat; spoon over blueberries to glaze. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
